# Cryptocurrency Dashboard

Hi! My name is Oskar MÃ¤nnik and this is my simple cryptocurrency dashboard project.

I created a dashboard that fetches live data from the CoinGecko API and displays it in a user-friendly table. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no backend required.

## Features

- Displays real-time cryptocurrency market data, including:
  - Name
  - Logo
  - Current Price
  - Market Cap
  - Highest and Lowest Prices in 24h
  - Price Change in 24h
- Search functionality to filter cryptocurrencies by name or symbol.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.
